# INFO 2950 Final Project
 Bayne, Joos, Pearson Final Project INFO 2950

-- The original owner of the repository was unable to make it public, so I took the files and made it public here! If you are here to observe our project, I would suggest downloading everything and saving in a folder named "INFO-2950-Final-Project-main", then either use VS.Code or Jupyter to browse our project! :)
