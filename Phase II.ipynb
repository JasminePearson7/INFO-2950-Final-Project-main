    "For this phase, we began by collecting eleven data sets across our six factors, as well as one for UFO sightings. While year is a factor in our analysis, we chose to group our data on year, and so it is not a factor we outline below because we collected no data sets on it specifically. We outline them below:\n",

    "We scraped five data sets on drug use from the publically released National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one for each of the following years: 2021, 2019-2020, 2017-2018, 2015-2016, and 2013-2014. There was no published data for 2022. The information for data sets between 2017-2021 was only able to be downloaded in HTM or PDF format from the website. So, we downloaded the files locally as HTM, then re-saved them as HTML. Years 2013-2016 had to be manually inputted, as there was no format accesible (within the realm of this class) to scrape. The data sets contained information for ages 12+, and for each illicit drug type showed use for lifetime, past year, and past month.\n",

For example, in our religion data set, the counts of different religions first seemed like they were all integers, but upon inspection a few of them were floats. While this wasn't hard to fix, it did take time to figure out which data entries needed fixing. We also ran into an issue with the HTM file. Upon trying to download it, it removed itself from the computer and didn't appear. Once we restarted the computer and downloaded the file to the desktop instead of into a folder, we were able to correctly save and convert it to HTML. "
